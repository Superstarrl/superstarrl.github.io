                    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em>Code: Abandoned</em> is an action-adventure prototype set in a decayed cyberpunk world where discarded
                        technology has evolved into hostile creatures known as Tech Beasts. You play as Q, an android who awakens
                        without memories and must repair, upgrade, and rediscover their identity through combat and exploration.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Intent vs. Outcome</h3>
                    <p>
                        From the start the team was aiming to create a fast-paced environment that made sure the player was always moving quickly in pursuit of the goal.
                        We also wanted to have responsive movement systems that was fun to interface with, and enhanced the gameplay experience we were looking for.
                        Following the conclusion of this project, I believe we were largely successful in carrying out our vision. While I believe given more time there
                        could have been additional polish that made the game even better, I am happy with the state it is in.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Gained an understanding for how to lead a team of coders, and manage a codebase for the entire team</li>

                        The following snippets highlight my standards for naming, readability, commenting, and modular design:
                    </p>

<pre><code>void DashAttack(float length)
{
    GameObject player = GameObject.Find("Player");

    GameObject attack = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);

    // decouple from player
    attack.transform.parent = null;

    // set size and position and rotation
    attack.transform.localScale = new Vector3(length, 3f, 0.5f);
    attack.transform.position = player.transform.position; // move to player position
    attack.transform.Translate(player.transform.forward * (length / 2)); // move halfway past player
    attack.transform.rotation = player.transform.rotation; // rotate to same as player
    attack.transform.Rotate(0, -90, 0); // rotate again to correct angle

    // make invisible
    attack.GetComponent&lt;Renderer&gt;().enabled = false;
    // make trigger
    attack.GetComponent&lt;Collider&gt;().isTrigger = true;
    // give it attack tag
    attack.tag = "AttackBox";
    // assign its script
    attack.AddComponent&lt;AttackBox&gt;();
