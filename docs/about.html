        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Systems Designer currently studying Digital Media with a specialization in
            Game Design at the University of Central Florida. While I specialize in systems design,
            I also have experience working with many areas of game programming including AI behaviour,
            combat systems, and movement systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy designing and implementing interconnected gameplay systems that feel responsive,
            readable, and satisfying for players.
