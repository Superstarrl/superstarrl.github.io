        <h2>Mechanisoul (In Development)</h2>

        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>
            <em>Mechanisoul</em> is an in-progress action game about a mechanical being discovering
            its own consciousness through combat, exploration, and interaction with a world built
            from modular machines. The focus of the project is on responsive character control,
            readable combat behavior, and systems that support expressive player choices.
        </p>

        <h3>Context & Production</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Development Status:</strong> Active, in-progress prototype</li>
            <li><strong>Duration so far:</strong> (Insert current weeks/months of work)</li>
            <li><strong>Team Size:</strong> (Solo / small team — fill in)</li>
            <li><strong>Role:</strong> Systems Designer & (Programmer, Designer, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Unity, C#, version control, DCC tools, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Mechanisoul is being built as a long-term sandbox for testing character controllers,
            AI behavior, and progression systems that I can reuse and expand across multiple
            projects. The current phase is focused on solidifying core movement, combat feel,
            and iteration tools before building full levels or narrative content.
        </p>

        <h3>Intent & Current State</h3>
        <p>
            The intention is to create a tightly scoped combat experience with a strong sense
            of weight, impact, and clarity. Right now, the game includes an early character
            model, baseline movement, and prototype combat interactions. Some systems are still
            placeholder or blocked out, and the visuals are expected to change as the mechanics
            stabilize. The page will continue to evolve as new milestones are reached.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Have Learned So Far</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How to prototype character rigs and animations to support responsive control.</li>
            <li>Better workflows for iterating on movement speeds, turn rates, and timing windows.</li>
            <li>Improved structure for separating input, movement, and combat logic for reuse.</li>
            <li>Early lessons in scoping vertical slice goals for an ongoing project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Systems Breakdown</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Character Controller:</strong> Movement, jump/dash (if applicable), and camera integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Combat System:</strong> Basic attacks, hit detection, feedback, and planned combo/ability hooks.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Foundations:</strong> Placeholder enemies or targets used for timing and spacing tests.</li>
            <li><strong>Progression Plans:</strong> Concepts for upgrades, abilities, or modular parts to expand replayability.</li>
            <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Any custom editor scripts or debug views created to help tune values quickly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Raw Gameplay Footage</h3>
        <p>Add short clips that show the current state of the game, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Character movement and basic traversal.</li>
            <li>Combat tests against dummy targets or early enemies.</li>
            <li>Camera behavior and readability of silhouettes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sandbox Demonstrations</h3>
