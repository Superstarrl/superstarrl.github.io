        <h2>Code: Abandoned</h2>
        <p>
            In a dystopian, cyberpunk future, e-waste has become more than just discarded junk, it has come to life. 
            As an android named Q, you awake in a dark alleyway with no memory of your past, only to discover that the world around you is populated by hostile, 
            sentient creatures formed from rogue tech and discarded appliances. Fight your way through this broken, chaotic world by battling the Tech Beasts, 
            gathering their parts to repair and evolve yourself, and slowly uncovering the mysteries of your forgotten existence.
